# MCP Snapshot Management and Reporting using Ansible

This collection of Playbooks can be used to enable the snapshot service on servers as well as report on snapshot status

## Information
**Version:** 1.0.0

**Author:** Ken Sinfield <ken.sinfield@cis.ntt.com>

## Requirements

### Reporting System Requirements (when using the Playbooks)

* <250 servers 2GB of RAM 2 vCPUs
* 250-750 servers 4GB of RAM 2 vCPUs
* \>750 servers 6GB of RAM 2 vCPUs
* Running 2 simultaneous reports against 2 different MCPs: Double the RAM and vCPU count

### Reporting System Requirements (when using the kensinfield.snapshot_reports.report module)

* 250-750 servers 1GB of RAM 2 vCPUs
* \>750 servers 2GB of RAM 2 vCPUs
* Running 2 simultaneous reports against 2 different MCPs: Double the RAM and vCPU count

### Ansible Version

* >2.9

### Python Modules

* jmespath
* requests
* configparser
* PyOpenSSL
* netaddr
* Jinja2
* PyYaml

To install these modules execute:

> pip install --user jmespath requests configparser PyOpenSSL netaddr Jinja2 PyYaml


## Ansible Collection(s)

Additionally, the NTTMCP-MCP Ansible Collection is required.

https://galaxy.ansible.com/nttmcp/mcp

> ansible-galaxy collection install nttmcp.mcp


To use the improved Snapshot reporting module which generates the same reports in on average 1/8 the time, install this additional Collection

https://galaxy.ansible.com/kensinfield/snapshot_report

> ansible-galaxy collection install kensinfield.snapshot_report


## Authentication

Configure Cloud Control credentials by creating/editing a `.nttmcp` file in your home directory containing the following information:

    [nttmcp]
    NTTMCP_API: api-<geo>.mcp-services.net
    NTTMCP_API_VERSION: 2.10
    NTTMCP_PASSWORD: mypassword
    NTTMCP_USER: myusername

OR

Use environment variables:

    set +o history
    export NTTMCP_API=api-<geo>.mcp-services.net
    export NTTMCP_API_VERSION=2.10
    export NTTMCP_PASSWORD=mypassword
    export NTTMCP_USER=myusername
    set -o history


## Playbooks

* **snapshot_report.yml** -- Use to generate a report showing servers with snapshots enabled and any failed snapshots

* **snapshot_service.yml** -- Use to enable snapshots for a provided list of servers using meta data tags within Cloud Control

* **snapshot_server_csv.yml** -- Use to enable snapshots for a provided list of servers via a CSV file (use example_server_input.csv as a template)

* **service_disable_csv.yml** -- Disables Replication and the Snapshot service on a list of server IDs

### snapshot_report.yml

* Update **region** and **mcp** extra-vars to the desired region and MCP ID.
* Optionally include a Cloud Network Domain with the variable **cnd** to limit the reporting to a specific Cloud Network Domain. Otherwise all servers within the MCP will be reported on

> snapshot_report.yml -e"region=na mcp=NA9"

### snapshot_service.yml

* Use with caution still in beta
* Update **region**, **mcp** (MCP ID where the servers are hosted), **rep_mcp** (MCP ID to be used for replication)
* Optionally include a Cloud Network Domain with the variable **cnd** to limit the reporting to a specific Cloud Network Domain. Otherwise all servers within the MCP will be reported on
* Tag names by default are 'snapshot' for the snapshot plan name and 'window' for the start time of the snapshot
* Default tag value mappings to Cloud Control snapshot plans can be found (and modified) in files/snapshot_config.json
* No batching at this stage so do not use for large numbers of servers (e.g. more than 15 at a time)
* Will skip servers that have already been enabled and had an initial snapshot taken (idempotent)
* Monitor snapshot.log for progress reports

> ansible-playbook snapshot_service.yml -e"region=na mcp=na9 rep_mcp=na12"

### snapshot_service_csv.yml

* Update **region**, **csv**, **primary_mcp** (MCP ID where the servers are hosted) and **secondary_mcp** (MCP ID to be used for replication)
* Takes an initial snapshot of the server once the service has successfully been enabled
* By default will process servers in batches of 15 servers at a time and pause for 30min to allow for the initial manual snapshot to be taken before proceeding
* Will skip servers that have already been enabled and had an initial snapshot taken (idempotent)
* Monitor snapshot.log for progress reports

> ansible-playbook snapshot_service_csv.yml -e"region=na csv=my_csv.csv primary_mcp=NA9 secondary_mcp=NA12"

### service_disable_csv.yml

* Update **region**, **mcp** (MCP ID where the servers are hosted), **rep_mcp** (MCP ID of the MCP used for replication), **csv** (path to the CSV file)
* This Playbook will determine if replication is enabled and disable this first. Disabling replication can take 2-4 hours before the service can be disabled
* Subsequent runs of the Playbook will attempt to disable the Snapshot service completely.
* If replication is still in the process of disabling, the Playbook will skip attempting to disable the service and the Playbook can be run again at a later date
* The included file example_disable.csv shows the format for the CSV

> ansible-playbook service_disable_csv.yml -e"region=na mcp=na9 rep_mcp=na12 csv=DisableSnaps.csv"

## Dockerfile usage
The Dockerfile will create a container that is ansible enabled with necessary collections installed.  It can be used in any environment avoiding ansible version conflicts. It can even be used in windows where ansible normally cannot be used.

* clone repository
* enter cloned repo
```
cd snapshot_automation
```
* build using dockerfile
``` sh
docker build -t snapshot_automation:latest .
```
* create env file called .credentials containing the following:
```
NTTMCP_API=api-<geo>.mcp-services.net
NTTMCP_API_VERSION=2.10
NTTMCP_PASSWORD=mypassword
NTTMCP_USER=myusername
```
* run docker container with playbook and command
for region eu and mcp EU11 an example:
```
docker run -it -v $PWD/reports:/ansible/snapshot_automation/reports --env-file .credentials snapshot_automation ansible-playbook snapshot_report_module.yml -e"region=eu mcp=EU11"
```
reports will be in report folder
